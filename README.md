o Overview of your website (What it is, why you chose this topic)
My website is a promotion for the video game THE FINALS
o Features you implemented
I used a grid to lay it out, three different usable links that give the user more information, and an extral CSS to style it
o Hosting method used (XAMPP, MAMP, Ubuntu, or AWS)
I used MAMP to host it locally
o How to run the website locally or remotely (provide clear steps)
To run the website locally, you're going to need MAMP installed.
Once installed, drag the "Assignment1" folder into the htdocs folder within your MAMP files. 
Then turn on your local server.
You can use any browser but Fire Fox runs best. Go to the search index and type in "http://localhost/Assignment1/index.html".
And then boom you should now be in the website.
