  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>What is the finals?
  <p>The finals is a free to play online multipler fps game. 
  It has a variety of modes but the main gamemode is cashout.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Whats Cashout?
  <p>On paper cashout it's simple. 4 teams of 3 drop into a map and have to open vaults. These vaults drop cash boxes, and these cash boxes need to be inserted 
  inside a cashout station. Once it's in, the owner of the cashout needs to defend it from anyone who might steal it.
  Anyone can steal a cashout, and the process takes around 5 seconds. Once stolen, ownship of the cashout station goes to the team that stole it.
  You earn the cash inside said cashout station after 1 minute and 45 seconds. So whoever owns the cashout by the end of the timer gets all the money.
  The top two teams at the end of the round qualify and move on in the tournament. Oh yeah forgot to mention, the gamemode is in a tournament structure.</p>
  </li>
  <li>How is this fun?
  <p>I shouldn't have to explain why its fun, just go play and see for yourself.</p>
